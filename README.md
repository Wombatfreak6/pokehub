# PokeHub

PokeHub is a centralized repository for Pokémon-related projects, experiments, and ideas.

This repository is designed to grow over time, serving as a hub for learning, building, and experimenting with different concepts inspired by the Pokémon universe. Projects may range from simple frontend applications to more complex explorations involving APIs, UI/UX, and data handling.

## Goals
- Keep multiple Pokémon-themed projects organized in one place
- Experiment with frontend development and JavaScript concepts
- Build reusable ideas and features over time
- Maintain a clean and scalable repository structure

## Structure
Each project lives in its own folder and is self-contained. New projects can be added without affecting existing ones.

## Status
This repository is actively evolving as new ideas and projects are added.

## License
This project is open for learning and experimentation.
